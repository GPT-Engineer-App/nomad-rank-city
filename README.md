# nomad-rank-city

I want you build a web application that ranks cities based on how friendly they might be for digital nomads.  Make the web app mobile friendly.  Use a clean design. 

### Navbar
With name of app (NomadRank) 

### Hero
Explain the value prop of this app clearly, add a background image showing tropical beach

### Searchable list of cities
Each city should have a card that shows the name of the city, and the country. The cards should be in 3 columns in wide screens.  The api that contains the list of cities is hosted in this URL: https://sheetdb.io/api/v1/o88mcqdvgzk1f.  See an example of the API response below: 
[
{
"id": "1",
"city": "Bankok",
"country": "Thailand"
},
{
"id": "2",
"city": "Buenos Aires",
"country": "Argentina"
},
{
"id": "3",
"city": "Tokyo",
"country": "Japan"
},
{
"id": "4",
"city": "Chiang Mai",
"country": "Thailand"
},
{
"id": "5",
"city": "Mexico City",
"country": "Mexico"
},
{
"id": "6",
"city": "Hong Kong",
"country": "Hong Kong"
}
]
